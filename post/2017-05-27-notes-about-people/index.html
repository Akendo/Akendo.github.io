<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>I have been criticize many times in my past for mistakes that were done. However, they just pointed the finger on what&rsquo;s wrong.
&ldquo;You need to do this better&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s not helpful. Somehow this sounds normal for many, but it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, criticism is essential for everyone. We need it to become better in things we do. The questions is often how it&rsquo;s done. One example that comes to my mind is grammar. I&rsquo;m not good with grammar.</p>
<p>Especially when I wrote documentation. There is a always something I get wrong.</p>
<p>But you can tell someone that he made mistake in his writing or you can tell them that there are bad because of such mistakes.
One points at a flaw, which is nice. The other is making you feel bad. Even worse you&rsquo;re being punished for a mistake. But this way you&rsquo;ll not get better with it.</p>
<p>Pushing for mistakes is a common patter I have seen over the past years. But it&rsquo;s like a poison and not productive.
Sure sometimes it can help. But most of the times it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point I want to make: Try not to do this. Try to add value to the things.
Sometimes just the attempt is of value. It&rsquo;s much about how we judge others and it&rsquo;s hard to not fall for this pit.
Point out where a mistake lies. Tell them how to detect them. Maybe how to prevent them for the further.
Don&rsquo;t make them feel bad about the mistake, help to feel good doing so and that they learning about it.</p>
<p>best regards
Akendo</p>
