		<p>Restarting a computer sucks. You have to typing in passwords, starting your windows manager, get all your default applications going and so on.
It takes me several minutes to restart a system and get it into a workable state.</p>
<p>Particularly in the last days, I had to restart various times forcefully. A critical error in the intel grahicstack breaks the multi monitor setup. Not working suspend to ram. A half way down suspended system, in which the fan keeps being active while remaining part of the systems is without a responses. Each time a system reset was necessary.</p>
<p>However, i found some useful tool that allows me  to &lsquo;accelerate&rsquo; the startup by quite a bit. <code>wmctrl</code>is the tool, that was found by browsing through the man page of fluxbox. What&rsquo;s it? It&rsquo;s a protocol the X Server is speaking, allowing to ask the Windows Manager for some information and/or actions. It allows you to give the windows manager some commands. Neat. The installation on archlinux was easy:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pacaur -S wmctrl
</code></pre><p>Why do you need this? Simple: To allow to start up any application in fluxbux and place it on the right virtual desktop. Window Manager like KDE allows you to remember the state of windows before a logout, fluxbox don&rsquo;t. So when you login again with KDE, all your old windows will be start on the right virtual desktop. But KDE consumes way to much resources&hellip;so a solution for fluxbox is necessary.</p>
<p>The man page has all the details one might need to use it. I wrote down an example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>urxvt -title urxvt -e tmux a &amp;
sleep 1
wmctrl -F -r &#39;urxvt&#39; -t 2
</code></pre><p>What does this example do?</p>
<p>It starts a <code>urxvt</code> terminal with a define title and within it will start the <code>tmux a</code> to re-attach to an open tmux session. Defining the title allow <code>wmctrl</code> to find the windows to move it to the right virtual desktop. The ID of a virtual desktop can be displayed with <code>wmctrl -G -l</code> command. One thing that did&rsquo;t work out (yet),
was setting the window to fullscreen. You can start <code>urxvt</code> will the paraemter <code>-g</code> with the right size. But this lead to some strange rendering bug and you can&rsquo;t read anything from the terminal down. <code>wmctrl</code> can do this too. But I didn&rsquo;t do it yet.</p>
<p>Anyways, this makes a reboot a bit easier. But in the end, reboot sucks.</p>
