		<p>This last week was suffered the typical post-easter slowness. It takes some time to get back to business as usually. Besides, of these, I also have difficulty in getting back into blogging at the moment. Not sure how I should get back into it, there is just much to be done.</p>
<p>Yet, I’m happy about the rust program I develop and that I manage to blog about. Also, the next post for rust is around the corner !</p>
<p>Short: Everything have moved on so slightly.</p>
<p>I made progress with the Grafana post, because I’m able to use the hackmd services again! The post there I split, also, it is a good cross posts for the PV topic, hence, it will also touch rust. Going through these post show me a lot of mistakes I’ve made and helped me to understand much more about things once more!</p>
<ul>
<li>PV (Part three)</li>
<li>Blog CI/CD (Part three)</li>
<li>Rust (Part two)</li>
<li>kernel exploration (First chapter completed)</li>
<li>nftables</li>
</ul>
<p>The Infrastructure is more in place. There are however other problems. My task warrior broke down, and I do not know why. Also, my VPN restarted suddenly, and I had to cope with my non-persistent nftable rules,  again I learned more about nftable. So it helps to progress the nftables subject too.</p>
<p>In this week I’m going to be on the way, so I do not know how much time I have to blog while being on the road. But I guess I can return to the CI.</p>
<p>So far,<br>
akendo</p>
