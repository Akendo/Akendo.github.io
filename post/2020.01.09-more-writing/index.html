		<p>A Happy new year everyone, this is a late one! I have a bit of an announcement to make: There will be more blog posts! This Blog should be used more often and I’m going to develop a better habit of writing thoughts and current topic in here.</p>
<p>The blog was created initially as a side project, but sufferers from a leak of attention. Most posts do not have the quality to be published in my view and because everything should be more as perfect, but I do not publish posts at all. But the writing helps to gather thoughts and ideas about a topic and aids in becoming more focused about and this is what matters more.</p>
<p>Until this point writing has been a very vulnerable process of mine. Sharing composed texts with others feel like sharing a part of me. A friend of mine phrased it as the following: The fear of publishing.</p>
<p>Even now it takes way more time than planed, it should have been a short post and I’m spending more than half an hour on this text…but writing is hard, isn’t? However, many ideas and thought I had about a posts could have been an immense help in the past, because it adds the power to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>So what should be written in here?</p>
<p>In one way I&rsquo;m going share some of my internal documentation composed over the last years. I quite often document things, but not share them.
It&rsquo;s mostly one or two lines of written text, however, it contributes over time a lot of value. On the other side, I&rsquo;m going to write some more opinions and views I have.</p>
<p>How will this look like? There should a post about something each week. At the moment this is intended for Monday, however, this might change.</p>
<p>So far
akendo</p>
