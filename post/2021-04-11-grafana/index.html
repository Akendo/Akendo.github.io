<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>This is a follow-up post for my <a href="/post/2021-01-08-photo-voltaic/">PV</a> and <a href="/post/2021-01-12-pv-power-recording/">Power Recording</a>. Before I continue on the next step, it is necessary to make a side-step. This means, I&rsquo;m going to write about the follow-up about something completely different that becomes vital in the blogging process later.  This is a recap of some old notes that I tried to scrap tougher to write a post. It lingers for 1 ¹/2 years in my to-do list and I though it might be a good addition to the series to make sense as a whole.</p>
<h1 id="grafana-network-statistics-and-tcp-time_wait">Grafana, network statistics and <code>TCP TIME_WAIT</code></h1>
<p>I’ve started to collect statistical data with Grafana since 2018. At first it was just some data with no real implication and for fun. However, ever since I’m fascinated with data provided by Linux. The kernel provides a variety of information to work. In my mind I had the idea to record the traffic statistics of my router. For a long time this was not possible, but since I’ve installed OpenWrt on my router this has changed. With a shell required I can utilize data from the kernel.</p>
<p>Most of this data can be found within the <code>/proc/net/dev</code> file. Here is an example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Inter-|   Receive                                                |  Transmit

</code></pre><p>For a different project, I had installed <a href="/post/2016-12-31-grafana/">Grafana</a>. So, how do I get the data from my Router to Grafana?</p>
<h2 id="bash-all-the-way">bash all the way</h2>
<p>My first solution was fairly primitive. You&rsquo;re going to see how this continues to develop over the course of time. To start we will log into the router and run <code>cat</code> on the <code>/proc/net/dev</code>. This output will be truncated:</p>
<pre><code>cat /proc/net/dev|grep wlp3s0 |awk '{print $2,$10}'
</code></pre>
<p>With that <code>cat</code> command you&rsquo;re getting the amount of bytes there were received and transmitted by interface <code>wlp3s0</code>. Wrap it on your laptop in <code>ssh</code>, and we have the data!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> What you&rsquo;re getting back are simple values counted in bytes in that moment in time. This is odd, because usually we handle network traffic in bit. Anyway, the next step is to format the given value.</p>
<p>Before I continue, I need to write that I do not use InfluxDB anymore. Instead, I’m using <a href="http://graphiteapp.org/">Graphite</a>. Unlike InfluxDB it seemed to be simple in adding data into the storage. Also, I started to run it with the docker container. It provides all the necessary thing you need:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>docker run -d \
 --name graphite \
 --restart=always \
 -p 80:80 \
 -p 2003-2004:2003-2004 \
 -p 2023-2024:2023-2024 \
 -p 8125:8125/udp \
 -p 8126:8126 \
 graphiteapp/graphite-statsd
</code></pre><p>And putting some data into the service we run:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;foo.bar 1 `date +%s`&quot; | nc localhost 2003
</code></pre>
<p>To change the data we had from the <code>/proc/net/dev</code> to a fitting format we execute:</p>
<pre><code>echo openwrt.network.wlp3s0.receive (cat /proc/net/dev | grep wlp3s0 |awk '{print $2}') (date +%s)
openwrt.network.wlp3s0.receive 10858659523 1618172800
</code></pre>
<p>Back when I did this the first time, I’ve used a script to go through the entry devices files and read all interfaces. I’ve lost that part, but for this post I think this is enough.</p>
<h3 id="downside-to-the-bash">Downside to the bash</h3>
<p>That approach had several disadvantages: each request takes fairly long because each connection would require a new SSH handshake. This could be worked around by having a persisting ssh tunnels, however, the strain it had onto the CPU is huge. It is for the reason that this is a OpenWrt router and the MIPS CPU does not have much processing power at hand.</p>
<p>Also, the result would be printed onto my local system and needed to be forward afterwards to the graphite service. It was not fault tolerant at all…</p>
<p>In the next post we&rsquo;re going to see some other problems too.</p>
<p>So far,<br>
