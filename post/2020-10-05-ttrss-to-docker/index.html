		<h1 class="post-title">TTRSS to Docker</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>Some time ago I wrote about the <a href="https://blog.akendo.eu/post/2014-01-05-tinytiny-rss/">TinyTiny RSS</a>. I did shutdown the service in 2017 because the server it was running got de-provisioned. But everything was stored on a backup.</p>
<p>Since I got some time to spare I&rsquo;ve decided to re-active the TT-RSS service, however, because I lack the server in the internet, it was moved to a small system at home. This time the deployment should be run on a docker container to allow better deployment. The TT-RSS project itself provides a <a href="https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/ttrss-docker-compose/src/master/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose</a> file. It is spilited into seperated container for different task. Many aspects of the services has been decopubled including an container to updated the feeds.</p>
<p>The container names are quite self-explanatory:</p>
<ul>
<li>db: Database of the application</li>
<li>app: The TT-RSS php code</li>
<li>backup: Frequend job to execute backups of the database</li>
<li>update: The PHP code that will trigger the refreshing of the feeds</li>
<li>web: Small webserver to handle requests and forward them to app</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="importing-the-containers">Importing the containers</h2>
<p>To get started I&rsquo;ve ported the <code>app</code> and <code>db</code> from the offical <a href="https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/ttrss-docker-compose/src/master/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose</a> first to my personal docker-compose file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  db:
    restart: always
    image: &#39;postgres:13-alpine&#39;
    volumes:
      - &#34;./volumes/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/data&#34;
    environment:    
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
  ttrss:
    ports:
      - &#34;9000:9000&#34;
    build: 
      context:
        ./ttrss
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - DB_TYPE=pgsql
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_NAME=${POSTGRES_USER}
      - DB_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
      - DB_PASS=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      - OWNER_UID=${OWNER_UID}
      - OWNER_GID=${OWNER_GID}
      - SELF_URL_PATH=${SELF_URL_PATH}
    volumes:
      - &#34;./volumes/ttrss/:/var/www/html&#34;
    depends_on:
      - db
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;m doing this because of a  pre-existing infrastructure hosted with docker, this way I can use some services already in place like nginx for instance.</p>
<p>The appended configuration was already altered, the <code>app</code> was renamed to <code>ttrss</code> to be more identifiable with in the many services I run. Also, I prefer to use relative paths to provide storage. Once the changes were in place we only had to run <code>docker-compose up ttrss</code>. As expected, the first start was not successful, but why?</p>
<p>Accessing the port 9000 of <code>ttrss</code> container directly caused the connection to be restted. Maybe the port forward was not working correctly?
After some check it became clear: The <code>ttrss</code> container only takes CGI requests and the <code>web</code> container was necessary to process the CGI resources from Caddy and forward it correctly to the <code>ttrss</code> container. So I copied it down the web entry. It also became necessary to update the upstream name of the <a href="https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/ttrss-docker-compose/src/master/web/Caddyfile">Caddyfile</a> to be not <code>app</code> but <code>ttrss</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  web:
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=ttrss
      - VIRTUAL_PORT=2015
    build: ./web
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - &#34;./volumes/ttrss/:/var/www/html:ro&#34;
    depends_on:
      - ttrss
</code></pre><p>Once <code>web</code> started it was almost completed. Accessing the port 2015 opens the website of ttrss and asking for a password. At this stage I didn&rsquo;t know the default password of the service. I tried some basic things like &lsquo;admin:admin&rsquo; and so on. After five minutes I decided to try a different way, right, check for the password with in the database and google the hash. The default password of TT-RSS is &lsquo;password&rsquo;. Gosh I should have tested that, who ever will guess this, I didn&rsquo;t !?</p>
<h2 id="proper-serving-of-my-old-instance">Proper serving of my old instance</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a <code>nginx-proxy</code> within the docker-compose file that reads out the environment variables for the hostname parameter, this way the proxy knows what name to listen for and where to forward the traffic to for a corresponding container. Once this is configured you&rsquo;re can access the service with the hostname in my case it will serve <code>http://ttrss</code>.</p>
<p>On this point we need to update the <code>.env</code> to include the correct hostname. I had to rebuild the <code>ttrss</code> container and the took a bit of time until the redirection from the <code>nginx-proxy</code> was working.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have now a running TT-RSS service within a docker-compose. The next part will be the database restoration and migration, because it takes quite more effort to get it running it will be a post of it&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>so far<br>
