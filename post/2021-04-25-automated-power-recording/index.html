		<h1 class="post-title">Automated Power Recording</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>This post continues on the post from 12 of January[0].</p>
<p>With the PV connected to the grid, I wanted to ensure what power is injected. For this I used a power meter with an LCD. This is a nice way to see what’s the power of the given moment or the power overall. However, this is quite some effort to do. Every day, I have to write down what the value was and the position of the socket was everything but user-friendly. Additionally, to this, there was the problem of not being always around. I went to camp and wasn’t home to write down the recorded power.</p>
<p>So I had some time to think about how to cope with this. For another idea of mine I’ve checkout something called smart sockets:</p>
<p><img src="/pictures/IMG_20190822_140952.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>These are some small chips with a giant relay attach to it. It allows to power up or down a connected device. In the image we can see a power socket we toyed around during the CCCamp. The problem with many of these sockets is the vendor have  created a cheap device, that can only be operated by them via the cloud, and even the basic server operation isn’t ensured.</p>
<p>Instead, I decided to search for a privacy-friendly alternative that might also include power metering. I found this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.tp-link.com/res/images/products/HS110_us_V1_1133_normal_0_20151017154946.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A TP-Link HS-110 with a power meter included. The best part is, that you do not need to put them online. You can control the entry thing locally. There is a good YouTube video of the disassembling of the given devices to option a better understanding of the device:</p>
<style>
.video-container {
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
    width:100%;
}

.video-container::after {
    padding-top: 56.25%;
    display: block;
    content: '';
}

.video-container iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

</style>
