		<h1 class="post-title">Thinking Ahead</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>I did not manage to publish a post the recent days, and I’m wondering why. It might be a problem with my planning. I notice, that I often do not plan much ahead when it comes to blogging.</p>
<p>My process relies on having a fixed point of time when I start to work on something. Often things are written as I go. I guess the first problem is abstraction. Because to write something including to have a sense or direction where something should go. Planing includes to distingué between the intent and the abstraction.</p>
<p>Handling abstraction is always more effort for planning. Because it requires attentiveness to get it right. When you say: I’m planning to write about Rust. It does not include a specific topic, instead, it might be everything that relates to it. When my planning is that ambiguously it might be not that effective.</p>
<p>At this moment I have to put the abstraction into the moment and deal with it when the moment arises. This fosters the problem when you’re in a low-energy state you won’t do it. When you spend then entry day busy with something you do not have the energy to decide what you’re going to write about.</p>
<p>Planning means to take a decision and define exactly what’s the matter is. But that means to cope with a complexity before it arises. I guess here is a problem of mine. The scope of what I try to do or express grows. There are more complexity that for what I’ve planned, and suddenly you&rsquo;re in need to adapt on the fly.</p>
<p>Now here comes a question: Do you stick to the plan or do you adapt?</p>
