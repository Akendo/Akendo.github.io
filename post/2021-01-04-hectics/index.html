		<h1 class="post-title">Hectics</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>Yesterday, I had a intense conversation about the topic of hecticness. Meaning when a person becomes rushes into finishing a task or something.</p>
<p>The key take away is the following: We have tendency to avoid unpleasant things. Becoming hectic is a strategy of avoids, instead of focusing on doing it good, you choose to get done as fast as possible. This leads however to a decline in quality in any regards. This is a quite intense recognition to me. In learn therapy it is a sign of discomfort when the persons speeds up. But more it is a form of habit that is pick up implicitly.</p>
<p>Moreover what you should do instead is taking it more slowly, something very difficult. That&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t focus on goals but on systems instead. A habit should therefor not be in place to make you more effective or help you to reach your goal. Instead it should be understood as a system in which reach your goal is an outcome of that very system. Meaning that the achievement one desires is rather a symptom of a good system not it&rsquo;s destination. Obviously, you can&rsquo;t generalise that all hectics are a representation of discomfort. When you&rsquo;re stress because there is a time limit that perfectly normal, I guess.</p>
<p>But making the parallel to my difficulties to write are quite well paralleled. Writing was always something I assumed everyone is able to do perfectly fine and my struggle is only a reflection of my own inadequacy. So I&rsquo;ve become hectic and try to be done as quick as possible. This triggered a negative feedback loop: Because I was rushed, I made mistakes, this mistakes were noticed and I receive the negative feedback that reinforcing my view of inadequacy in terms of writing.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a fantastic insight?</p>
<p>so far,<br>
