For a while now, I do have this type of error message: 

```
error: failed to read `/Cargo.toml` 
                                    
Caused by:                                        
  No such file or directory (os error 2)
```
The problem:

I had by accident a `Cargo.toml` file within my home folder. This had a strange downside. Apparently does cargo check for this file on each folder on the way. 

My idea: the check should display the folder in whitch he found a `Cargo.toml` file. So you can prevent this type of problem, by posting which file is currently in controll.
