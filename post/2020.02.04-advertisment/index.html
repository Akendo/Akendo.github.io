		<p>Today, a intersting story was told to me: In a time before we did  use paper towels.</p>
<p>People were appalled about this. &ldquo;What using a piece of paper to do what?&quot;. The manfacture of the product creates specially advertisment that try to teach people the benefit of these products.</p>
<p>I think that they succeded.</p>
<p>How our thinking affects our behaviour.</p>
<p>In one instance how we choose convient over effectiveness. Because it seems more effect on the short term than on the long term.</p>
<p>The othere instance is that effectiveness of advertisment.</p>
<p>An example with advertisment</p>
<p>advertisment is just similar to the paper towels, not all of it, but most of it.</p>
<p>The worst part of advertisment is, that it tries to create a need where none is.</p>
<p>advertisment causes us to consume more than we really need.</p>
<p>A while ago I&rsquo;ve met a person who was in the buisness of selling advertisment and he had
some really great insight. The most important one was: None want so evaluate the advertisment
seen on our screen. While we have the technogly to do so, the industir is very well aware of
it&rsquo;s own ineffectness. However, it&rsquo;s a buisness that is running, so why change the rules?</p>
<p>I think for online advertisment this is pretty similar problem. Untill now there was only a single
advertisment in my life that really caused me to become engaged. Everything else was just an annoying</p>
