<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>This week the first difficulties in writing every arise. Basically, I&rsquo;m missing the necessary time to get things done. Why is this now?</p>
<p>But first things first, what have changed in the last week?</p>
<ul>
<li>PV (part two)</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>nftables</li>
<li>kernel exploration</li>
<li>Blog CI/CD</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all topics stayed the same. I moved on with kernel exploration, but I have to put the notes into a more readable state. I worked on the CI/CD pipeline, but my server broke down. I updated various things within the blog. Some other topics became more urgent over the week. For instance, I had to update the  MediaWiki to fix some bugs. I did continue on that matter and going to add this to the list now.</p>
<h3 id="introspection">Introspection</h3>
<p>Let us ask ourselves why. The question should be more directed to where the time went. For once,  I had to fight with one server that was crashing.  The server was host to many services like grafana, a data processing program to collect information from the PV panel. I&rsquo;m in the process of replacing it,  until now. Here I got side-tracked and was suddenly fighting with system updates for a Gentoo host.</p>
<p>Those are the subjects for the technical nature. For writing, the problem was that I  suddenly been confronted with spending more time incorporating feedback than I anticipated. My idea was to write as the first thing each morning. I did not foresee the time feedback requires. Whenever a post is published, some of you are providing suggestions for improvements. That is new.</p>
<p>Mostly,  I spend the time re-phrasing posts and improve grammatical errors. Ahhh sweet, sweet grammar issues&hellip; Grammar has always been one weak point of mine. Some of you have pointed that out. I very thankful for it and try to incorporate all of it. Yet whenever someone points such a mistake out, it hurts. To improve on my Grammar I&rsquo;m using grammarly[0] now.</p>
<p>Due to that fact, I do much more patching the actual writing moved into the evening. I tend to push a post without the necessary love for details. That is causing more patchwork to be done and causes new stuff to go online even further&hellip; damit it.</p>
<p>I guess pushing new stuff every day has its downside. The underlying fact is that with an increased rate of posts that the quality dwindles. It is reasonable, but here comes another matter of perfectionism. I do not want these mistakes in there and coping with that makes this thing difficult.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The best guess I have for now to improve is by changing the writing habit. Iâ€™m going to compose new posts in the evening. The next morning,
I will re-read the post for spelling errors before I publish it. This way, I can catch potential more flaws can improve things one more before it goes online. Let us see how things are going to be in this week!</p>
<p>so far,<br>
