		<p>In the last days I had to go through my older posts. Many of them where unevenly named or some did not have a correct header placed. To put this into numbers there are around 186 posts and around 60 are in draft status. Meaning that 1/3 of my written posts are drafts. …and it is quite a mess in there right now.</p>
<p>The pattern of creation is also interesting. For a longer period of days I’m idling. Then I have an explosion of ideas, up to three at once. However, often these keep in a draft state. Some posts are just created to catch the idea. Many  others are left  in an incomplete state. Few posts are fine, and I didn’t feel good about posting them&hellip;to keep it short: it is a mess.</p>
<p>Browsing through the posts I notice a  pattern in creation dates that is interesting. For a longer period of days I’m idling. Then I have an explosion of ideas, up to three at once. However, often these keep in a draft state. Some posts are just created to catch the idea. Many  others are left  in an incomplete state. Few posts are fine, and I didn’t feel good about posting them.</p>
<p>It works like this in detail, I think:  I start to work on the idea and while working on it,  I got another idea and start to do some research. This is where I get sidetracked. The worst moment are when I then get lost in details. Either for the research or the writing.</p>
<p>Here comes the funny thing: This pattern seems to be consistent over the last days when I wrote almost every day too. Long story short: I need to work ion my planning.  Because I get sidetracked that often, I should ask of how to handle this more better?</p>
<p>This might be related to my writing process in which  I mixed up the different types of task. Frequently, I start to write without a topic and follow the flow, just like this post. At some point I need to search something or need to know something. Here the new idea strikes me and I start to focus on this topic.</p>
<p>Instead, I should try to have a more narrow idea what I try what I want to write or either I completed the research and make the notes separately. Once I&rsquo;ve completed it, I write about what I&rsquo;ve found.</p>
<p>so far,<br>
