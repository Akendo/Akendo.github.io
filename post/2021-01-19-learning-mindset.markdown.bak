I've got some feedback and I love it.

One thing I however want to highlight is the following: Everything I write here is a represenation of my humble understanding. Nothing is really fixed here and it should help me to understand more what's going on in the word. I use the wrting as a tool to make sense of this very complexe world and I'm open for new information, theories and ideas that might improve on that fact.

At certian point you learn, that you do not know that much of the world and are beging force to devise model that tries to explain what's going on. However, this models are never correct. There might predict or explain a thing or two, but often a incomplete representation of reallity.


Another thing that I've learned from the feedback that I recieved so far is that the idea that I've tried to convery was not precieved. Instead, people focused more stronger on the subject my ideas realted to and felt more confortiable with. This implies to me that the text was well phrased and might mislead people to wring ideas.

Obviously is wrting hard and it is even more harder to protray what you intent to say.


Thinking is a process and learnig is key to it. Therefor it will happend that in one moment you make a statement that will be contridicated somewhen later. This causes often people to go avry, because we seek to have consisten view of people. We like when our thinking model is reliable and coping with such type of contridction causes them pain.

BUt learning why thing are is important to me and not become fixated on narrative is dangerous. Focusing on the why is more important, yet more difficult, because once we're in the emotion of pain we lose our ability to think logically and that makes us prune to all sorts of wired arguing 

Yet the world is a moving target and so do wehave to keep developing. 

Therefore I'm trying to aim to ask why someone tend to disagree, why something is and taking the time to listen. This is hard, particular because we then have a model that tries to predict his ideas and that can go arcy quickly. Why is the person not understanding my point or why is this a concern, where I just wrote/told something different. 

Learnig why this things are of a mattering nature to them help to understand oneself.

We need to test what we've learn as mus as possible and therefor this blog is very useful to compose this ideas and work with what i've learned.
