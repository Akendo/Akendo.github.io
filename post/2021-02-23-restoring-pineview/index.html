		<h1 class="post-title">Restoring Pineview</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>Pineview was my old production server at home. It did run many services like git, and I planned to use it be part of my CI/CD. However, some weeks ago the storage controller broke down and the disk where partly not recognized. When it was, the controller did not read data correctly from the disk.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I’ve started to restore it I’m using an old laptop. It is a nice change because the CPU in that laptop is much stronger than the Atom one. Furthermore, it can utilize the SSD better. But the CPU only support 32-Bit and that causes trouble because some software I run, runs mainly on 64-Bit.</p>
<p>What software? You might be surprised: docker and here is the thing. Technically, you have 32-bit support. For instance, Debian have 32-bit port, however,  only few  upstream docker repository do support 32-Bit natively. When you try to fetch an image chances are high that you&rsquo;re not getting an image that was built for 32-bit. This makes the entry docker for 32-bit broken.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to port some container manual with a 32-bit base image, but even then I got the follow error message:</p>
<pre><code>standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused &quot;exec format error&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>But this makes the restoring process difficult. I need to think what I should do next because porting 64-bit to 32-bit seems just ridiculous and running an emulation 64-bit seems stupid. I’m going to port the software out of the container probably. That removes the portability, but most of the software within should be able to run natively.</p>
<p>so far,<br>
