<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>A Happy new year everyone, this is a late one! I have a bit of an announcement to make: There will be more blog posts! I’m going to develop a better habit of writing thoughts and current topics in here.</p>
<p>The blog was created initially as a side project, but suffers from a leak of attention. Most posts do not have the quality to be published in my view and as I want everything to be perfect I often do not publish posts at all.</p>
<p>But the writing helps to gather thoughts and ideas about a topic and aids in becoming more focused about it and this is what matters more.</p>
<p>Until this point writing has been a very vulnerable process of mine.
Sharing composed texts with others feels like sharing a part of me. A friend of mine phrased it as the following: The fear of publishing.</p>
<p>Even now it takes way more time than planed, it should have been a short post and I’m spending more than half an hour on this text…but writing is hard, isn’t it? However, many ideas and thoughts I had about a post could have been an immense help in the past, because it adds the power to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>So what should be written in here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to share some of my internal documentation composed over the last years. It&rsquo;s mostly one or two lines of written text, however, it contributes a lot of value over time. On the other side, I&rsquo;m going to write some more opinions and views I have.</p>
<p>How will this look like? There will be a blog post each week, published on every Monday of the week.</p>
<p>So far
akendo</p>
