		<p>Normaly this link:<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/11/undermining-democracy.html">&lsquo;Undermining Democracy - Schneier on Security&rsquo;</a> would be just another link for my link drop, however, I like to add a thoughts to it: One of the key problems is that the Republicans have a very dichotomous thinking model - meaning to think in black and white terms. Leading to a collective narrative in which, whatever the democrats are doing is considered to be bad and only what the Republicans do is good.</p>
<p>We saw that behaviour in the Convid-19 responses in Congress regards to social benefits. Instead of prolonging them they remain stalled, because it would imply a bipartisan agreement to prolonge the benefits and be thefore be a compromise, which would be therefore a violation of the narrative of the Republican party.</p>
<p>For this very election the Republicans have decided that it is more important to consist to this narrative then the reality. And thanks to an abundant amount of misinformation it&rsquo;s possible find effortless stories that fit into this view. Allowing to victimize them and break with norms of a democracy. The democrats did something similar four years ago, I fear only that the ramification a way worse this time. While the democrats rejected the presedict they still upholded the basic princiable of a election.</p>
<p>This all leads to a cycle of polarisation and a dividing of the sides. One teach back in higher school predicted (around 15 years ago) that the U.S is going to civial war within the next 20 years and I something fear that this prediction becomes true.</p>
