		<h1 class="post-title">About Habits</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>Habits are difficult to maintain, at least new ones. Everyone can related to this the one or the other way. With a habit a
routine is implies that you do more than twice. However, the issue is doing the same routing over a longer period of time, why?</p>
<p>The answer I think might be quite simple: We want to feel good and we want to feel it now, however, there are many ways to get there. You &lsquo;repair&rsquo; your emotions by watching some funny thing or view some videos. You take the shortest path to get there, why spend more effort than necessary?</p>
<p>In short there are things that feel more well for us than the habit we intend to do.
Because in the beginning it&rsquo;s not rewarding enough. The first days maybe, but after a while it turn into actual work and that where
the first hard challenges to keep up arrives.</p>
<p>This might related to the time you have to spare, because you&rsquo;re on holiday for instance. Once the time, motivation or environment changes and you&rsquo;re back to the normal busy day where different topic take over you, are you going to resort back to the new habit? Will you make time for it what&rsquo;s your plan?</p>
<p>This is where the problem kicks in, because something new is always related to conscious decision. But with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200330-covid-19-how-to-learn-a-new-skill-in-coronavirus-quarantine">decision fatiguety</a> around the corner you only have so much capacity for something. On the end of the day you might skip it out to favor something you already know. That&rsquo;s why I think the habit shouldn&rsquo;t be a decision, instead it should be done when the timing is right until you feel good with it. For me this is in the beginning of a day.</p>
<p>But I already see some problem, it will be working well for properly two week, then I&rsquo;m going to hit the first &lsquo;wall&rsquo; where it becomes more and more work and I start to fall off.  Let&rsquo;s hope that I can keep up after that time.</p>
<p>so far,<br>
