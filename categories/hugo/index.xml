      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using hugo for some time now. However, one aspect of hugo was always a problem for me: Creating new posts with hugo new. This command will generate a new file with a minimal amount of meta-information necessary for a post. That&amp;rsquo;s the information above the written content like the title or the date. It also contains the option by default that the post is a draft.
I wanted to modify this behaviour for some time now.</description>

      <description>Hugo allows you to get very easy a new theme. Sometimes this new theme have some option you don&amp;rsquo;t want. For example:In this theme there is by default two additional menus. One for tags, for for categories. That&amp;rsquo;s something nice.
However, both menu had a very long list, that than needed scrolling bar. The scrolling bar broken than the design of the theme.
My fix for this was disable the two menu for categories and tags.</description>
