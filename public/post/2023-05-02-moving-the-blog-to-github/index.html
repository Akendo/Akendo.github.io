		<h1 class="post-title">Moving the Blog to GitHub</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to move my blog to GitHub temporary. Because I miss the time to maintain the underlying
infrastructure and make the changes that, I feel, are necessary to remain in a good state.</p>
<p>The migration is super simple. Create a GitHub repository with your Account name and point your
subdomain via a CNAME to it. Verify your domain via a TXT field and you should be good to go.
Obviously, you have to commit your HTML files into the repository.</p>
<p>Only the DNS migration takes longer until it is propagated through the DNS. There might be some
hiccup regarding the TLS certificate. It takes some time until Let&rsquo;s Encrypt picks up the change.
But it&rsquo;s only a matter of time, I think.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this change, it hurt a bit. I always valued running my own infrastructure. It made
you quite immune to all the turbulences many cloud services had. Since you just have a simple VM
with a webserver running.</p>
<p>But this infrastructure requires some love from time to time. And so does the Operating System.
Because the underlying Debian is turning older, I would have to migrate it away. This also affects
my mail setup, that  requires a fresh installation and I didn&rsquo;t stay up-to-date with the
technologies. And while I feel like that this is very little time to spend, I just can&rsquo;t spare it
at the moment. Lastly, I wanted to change my Let&rsquo;s Encrypt setup. But this requires additional
infrastructure that I cannot bear to run right now.</p>
<p>When my life has stabilized and have a bit more headspace to afford running infrastructure,
I&rsquo;m going to migrate once more. Just for the moment, it&rsquo;s the best solution.</p>
<p>best regards,<br>
akendo</p>
