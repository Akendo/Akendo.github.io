		<h1 class="post-title">Alone</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>You&rsquo;re at a party, talking to your friends and feeling comfortably at first. But at some point, rather then enjoying yourself, it starts to feel like that something is missing. The conversations you&rsquo;re having going a way you know. Not that you can say what there are going say exactly  or what words are going to used, but you know the refrain, just  like a pop song. Like any pop song. Words slip through, the voices soften.</p>
<p>An odd feeling kicks in and while you&rsquo;re surrounded by friends and family a feeling of hollowness arises. Everything seems pointless, every words seems empty. Nothing matters any more. You&rsquo;re alone. Alone in the middle of everyone, why? How? You mind can&rsquo;t answer, you mind does not know why and all what you&rsquo;ve having is boredom.</p>
<p>The voices fades away, everyone is absorbed by themself. You have no role to play, you&rsquo;re outside. Left behind. You&rsquo;re left alone. You want to belong to the other, you want to be seen. But instead of expression your wishes, thought, you play alone with the refrain. Like everyone else.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ask the questions you want to, you do not ask for what&rsquo;s the matter. Until it is over and you leave as empty as you have come. Spend time of your life for&hellip;? No one can tell you, no one knows.</p>
